<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My name is Haochang Luo, pronounced as "Haw-Chung Loh", written as "ÁΩóÊòäÊòå"(surname and given name reversed). 

I am now working as a postdoctoral researcher at the City University of New York, City College. üóΩ

My work focuses on the dynamics of large-scale convective systems and their interactions with other systems. Most of my targets are in the tropics and subtropics, for example, the Indian Summer Monsoon Low Pressure Systems (MLPSs) and African Easterly Waves (AEWs). Recently I have been eyeballing the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and actively studying Machine Learning. 

My research interest covers a broad range of topics including precipitation, convection, fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, tropical waves, eddies and disturbances. 
My research approaches are based on time series analysis such as linear regressions and composites, empirical orthogonal function (EOF, some people call it principal component analysis), maximum covariance analysis, power spectrum analysis, etc. 
With experience of coding in a Linux environment for more than 7 years, I am proficient in Python, NCL and Matlab. LaTex is my primary writing tool.
